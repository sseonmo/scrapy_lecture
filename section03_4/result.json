This time, AMD promises it\u2019s . And our first performance benchmarks prove it out.Maybe you\u2019ve already read our \u00a0(the \u2018H\u2019 means its intended for power users, and the \u2018S\u2019 means it\u2019s for \u201cslim\u201d-profile laptops). While that story contains a core suite of benchmarks, this story compiles all the tests we ran. We\u2019ll add more benchmarks as we test more of the first generation\u2014AMD expects about 100 laptops with Ryzen 4000 parts to ship this year.We conducted our tests using the \u00a0(),\u00a0a 14-inch laptop with Nvidia\u2019s new GeForce RTX 2060 Max-Q, 16GB of RAM, 512GB SSD, and a Ryzen 9 4900HS CPU. The comparison laptops we\u2019ve chosen are mostly in the ROG Zephyrus G14\u2019s class, as well as ones far larger, and far heavier. We also include a laptop with an older 7th-gen quad-core, so you can see just how far we\u2019ve come. They\u2019re not apples-to-apples, which is nearly impossible in the highly customized world of laptop design. We could have controlled more for comparable size and weight\u2014larger laptops tend to have better thermals\u2014but AMD actually wants you to see what this 3.5-pound laptop can do against 4.5-pound, 5-pound, and 7-pound laptops featuring Intel\u2019s CPUs.For the most part we tested the Ryzen 9 4900HS in the laptop\u2019s \u201cturbo\u201d setting, which is one click up from its default \u201cperformance\u201d setting. For all of the other laptops, we selected the performance results, but did not include any actual overclocked scores for those laptops.We should note that our comparisons mix mostly earlier test results with a few fresh numbers. Unlike our current desktop CPU reviews, where we keep the CPUs and re-run tests with refreshed drivers, BIOSes, and OS, laptop tests are a snapshot in time before we return review units to the company. It\u2019s not ideal, but when we\u2019ve been able to retest, we\u2019ve actually found little change. We\u2019ll have fresher results once laptops with Intel\u2019s newer 10th-gen chips show up.We put the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 through extra CPU tests to get a fuller view of what makes Ryzen 4000 tick. We start with the well-established Cinebench.Cinebench R15 is a 3D rendering benchmark made by Maxon. It\u2019s based on the engine from its Cinema4D product, which figures in such products as Adobe\u2019s Premiere video editor. This is an older test (but still relevant), so we have a healthy list of comparable Intel-based laptops.Like most 3D rendering engines, the test is heavily multi-threaded. The more CPU cores and threads you throw at it, the more performance you get. It runs on today\u2019s laptops in under a minute, so the all-core boost speeds of each laptop will have a larger impact.The results are nothing less than phenomenal for the Ryzen 9 4900HS. As you can see, it easily dispatches the 8-core Core i9-9980HK in the big Acer Predator Helios 700, as well as the 8-core Core i9-9880H in the MSI GE65 Raider. The old-school Ryzen 7 2700\u2014a desktop chip\u2014in the Acer Predator Helios 500 pulls up last among the 8-core CPUs. Intel\u2019s Core i7 and its older Core i9 chips with \u201cjust\u201d 6-cores can\u2019t hang, either.The reigning champion is neither surprising nor embarrassing for the Ryzen 9 4900HS. It\u2019s the Alienware Area 51m R1, a true beast with a desktop Core i9-9900K at its heart.Let that sink for a moment: A 3.5-pound Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 with a low-power Ryzen 9 4900HS is only about 5 percent slower than an 8.5-pound Alienware Area 51m R1 with a desktop Core i9-9900K. Granted, the Alienware could pull further away if overclocked, but this is a hell of a result for the Ryzen 9 4900HS.The song remains the same in Maxon\u2019s new Cinebench R20, which uses a far more current engine from Cinema4D, supports up to 256 threads, and also stresses AVX, AVX2 and AVX512 workloads. Add in the much longer run times, and you have a benchmark that is particularly tough on CPUs that rely excessively on boost clocks.You can see the results of the harsher workload below. The Ryzen 9 4900HS easily beats every single laptop Intel sells\u2014from 10-pound hulks to 5-pound workhorses with 8 cores inside. The only dog higher in the pile is once again the Alienware Area 51m R1. That\u2019s just wow.Multi-core performance is great, but the real world is often stuck in single-core land. While 3D modelling isn\u2019t the same as say, running Microsoft Word, running Cinebench R15 on a single thread is still a valid way to measure how a CPU reacts under a given single-core load.Intel\u2019s mature 14nm CPUs have a well-known advantage in high clock speeds in the 4.8GHz to 5GHz range. Here, the Ryzen 9 4900HS falls back a few notches, but it loses only to three laptops that weigh 2.5 times as much as the ROG Zephyrus G14. Even with the thermal advantage, the Core i9-9980HK is only 3 percent ahead, and the mighty desktop Core i9-9900K, a mere 6 percent. The Ryzen 9 4900HS also pulls ahead of the only arguable competitor here, the Core i9-9880H in the MSI GE65 Raider.We ran Cinebench R20 in single-threaded mode as well, and we were floored by the results. Although technically a tie, the Core i9-9880H and Ryzen 9 are dead even. With Intel\u2019s clock speed advantage, especially in single-threaded tasks, we didn\u2019t think it would be so close.For another perspective on CPU performance, we use the free HandBrake encoder to convert a 30GB, 1080p file using the Android Tablet preset. It\u2019s a multi-core CPU test that can take an hour to run on a quad-core lightweight laptop. Even on the more powerful laptops being tested here, HandBrake conversion can take around 20 minutes. That\u2019s enough time for most laptops to start to throttle down as the heat builds up around the busy CPU.Only the laptops with the very best cooling can sustain higher clocks. At least, that\u2019s the way it\u2019s been with Intel\u2019s 14nm chips. With the 7nm Ryzen 9 4900HS, you can apparently do well in this test simply by producing less heat. While the huge, thick Alienware Area 51m and Acer Predator Helios 700 come in first, right behind them is the 3.5-pound ROG Zephyrus G14. It\u2019s a bit like having two muscle cars lay skid marks and tear away at a greenlight\u2014only to see a golf cart pulling up just behind them at the next light.Almost all of the tests in this story are CPU-bound because we\u2019re focused on measuring solely the Ryzen 9\u2019s capabilities in the ROG Zephyrus G14. Because most of the laptops here have very different graphics chips, anything touching the GPU would muddy CPU performance.For those wondering how the Ryzen 9 would do in a theoretical game physics test, you can see that with UL\u2019s 3DMark Time Spy CPU score. The score isolates CPU performance during a multi-core CPU test. As we\u2019ve seen before, the two big \u201cmuscle books\u201d lead the way by about 10 percent\u2014and they also outweigh the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 by 2.5X to 3X.Of greater interest is the MSI GE65 Raider, with its 9th-gen, 8-core Core i9-9880H. Despite weighing in at five pounds, the GE65 Raider falls far behind the Ryzen 9 4900HS in the ROG Zephyrus G14.We know, we know, you still want to see how well the Ryzen 9 4900HS does in real games. We would too, but modern gaming is almost always about the graphics card. AMD does claim that its advantage in thermals with the Ryzen 4000 gives it an edge. To measure that though, we\u2019d need a similar class of laptop with the same GPU and the same cooling. And again, ideally, we\u2019d have this in the exact same model.Clearly, a 3.5-pound laptop with a GeForce RTX 2060 Max-Q in it can\u2019t easily be compared to a laptop with a GeForce RTX 2070, RTX 2080, or possibly even a RTX 2060.We can at least show you the results of the graphics systems from many of the laptops above. It\u2019s interesting to see the essential dead heat between the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 and a Dell G7 with a GeForce RTX 2060. That either means the lighter CPU thermal load from the Ryzen 9 does indeed help graphics performance, or there\u2019s something more to this new GeForce RTX 2060 variant in the ROG Zephyrus G14.We also ran the laptop through real games such as . The results are again quite impressive given the disparity in weights, but so muddied by the different GPUs that it\u2019s really hard to determine anything. What seems safe to say is that gaming with the ROG Zephyrus G14 is quite good, and in line what what you\u2019d expect of a laptop with an RTX 2060-class GPU and a fast CPU.We did consider running gaming laptops off of an external GPU, but without Thunderbolt 3 on the Zephyrus G14, it\u2019s not possible.One thing we have confirmed is the PCIe on the Ryzen 4000 is limited to x8 using Gen 3 technology for the discrete GPU. The SoC features another 12 lanes of PCI Gen 3 for various plumbing such as storage, WiFi, or 5G.Should this deter you from Ryzen? In our opinion, no. Few consumer graphics loads truly require the bandwidth of 16 lanes of PCIe. To give you an idea of how much it doesn\u2019t matter, Alienware\u2019s Area 51m R1 with a GeForce RTX 2080 also uses an 8-lane connection to the GPU. The other eight lanes are repurposed to support the company\u2019s external graphics amplifier."},
{"title": "Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 review: Ryzen 4000 makes this thin, light laptop a winner", "img_url": "https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/03/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-100836859-large.jpg", "contents": "We\u2019ve tested the new ROG Zephyrus G14, which debuts with AMD\u2019s stellar Ryzen 9 4900HS CPU, and we can safely say: Just give Asus your money. This laptop packs a stupid amount of performance into a stupidly small and stupidly light frame.To give you an idea of just how impressive this 3.5-pound, Ryzen 4000-based laptop is, you\u2019re talking about a weight class that typically gives you lower-power CPUs and GPUs. Yet the G14 can hang in CPU performance with laptops that weight 10 pounds.\u00a0Obviously the star of the show is the  separately. But the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 as a whole package is nearly as impressive, so keep reading to find out more.The ROG Zephyrus G14 model we reviewed () has the following configuration: 8-core AMD Ryzen 9 4900HS Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 Max-Q 16GB DDR4/3200 in dual-channel mode 1TB Intel 660P NVMe SSD Intel AX600 WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.0 14-inch \u201cIPS-like\u201d Full HD (1920x1080) @120Hz, which we measured at 280 nits\u2019 maximum brightnessThe G14 gives you a decent array of ports. The right side features two USB-A ports and one USB-C, along with a Kensington lock port.The right side features a barrel plug for the 180-watt power brick, and a full-size HDMI 2.0b port (hooked to the CPU\u2019s Radeon port). There\u2019s also another USB-C port with support for DisplayPort (through the GeForce RTX card) and USB-PD (Power Delivery). While you can\u2019t really run the laptop hard on a 100-watt USB-C charger, the idea is to give you a lighter-weight option than the included 180-watt brick when you\u2019re on the road (and not pushing it hard).Thunderbolt 3 and Gigabit ethernet are notably absent from the port array.\u00a0While we understand why Thunderbolt 3 is more difficult to obtain (given that the technology emanates from rival Intel), it does feel like onboard ethernet is important.The other glaring omission is the lack of an onboard webcam. You can see below where it should be, in the blank spot between the microphones. The rationale from Asus was apparently that you\u2019ll be using your far superior dedicated webcam to become a Twitch star. But webcams have been standard issue on most laptops for many years, so on the ROG Zephyrus G14 it seems like a feature more conspicuous for its absence.Getting inside the ROG Zephyrus G14 is easy, if not quick. You\u2019ll need a small Phillips-head screwdriver and the patience to remove a million screws. You then use a spudger or a thin piece of plastic, such as guitar pick, to nudge the case open carefully at the seam.Like most thinner laptops these days, there isn\u2019t much to do. There\u2019s one M.2 PCIe slot that\u2019s occupied by the Intel 660P SSD, and a single DDR4/3200 SO-DIMM.\u00a0The laptop we reviewed, with 16GB, comes with one 8GB module in place. The other\u00a0 8GB is on the reverse side of the motherboard in a module. The good news is it\u2019s dual-channel mode, so you won\u2019t hit memory bandwidth issues that impact performance. The bad news is if you want to get at that second slot, you\u2019ll have to pull out the motherboard.We\u2019d rate the keyboard and trackpad experience as generally good. There\u2019s decent travel and no oddly placed keys. We could complain about the tiny cursor keys, but at least they\u2019re in the traditional inverted-T style. The trackpad has slight metallic feel to it but works well and supports Microsoft\u2019s Precision driver.If we had to complain about the keyboard, we\u2019d say the backlighting is pretty medicore. We\u2019ve come to expect RGB in gaming laptops.Likely for power and space reasons, Asus sticks with boring white that\u2019s neither particularly bright nor even.Since we\u2019re talking abolut the keyboard deck, if you look at the picture above you\u2019ll see two small grilles to the right and left of the trackpad. Those cutouts allow sound from the modest speaker drivers to project straight up and at you, rather than firing out the side or into the desk surface. The sound is fair overall and gets decently loud, which is about as good as it gets for most laptops.Laptop build quality is usually in the eye of the beholder, but we\u2019d rate the ROG Zephyrus G14\u2019s as generally pretty good. The lid and keyboard deck are magnesium, while the bottom appears to be plastic. Overall it feels solid and can be held by one corner without feeling like it\u2019s going to buckle. Does it have the built-like a tank feel of a ? No, but it feels like a good compromise of performance-to-weight ratio."},

Now there is the suggestion of a wall\u2014which is to say, . Bricks lay scattered across the street and as the dust settles a shadow appears in the hole where the wall used to be.I am already running. Running back to safety, to the room where (for some reason) the Nemesis can\u2019t find me. Running as fast as I possibly can and knowing it\u2019s still not fast enough. Bracing for the fist in the back of my skull, or the tentacle to grab my leg and trip me up. It\u2019s that nightmare where you run and run from something but can\u2019t quite get away\u2014except it\u2019s no nightmare, and I am running through the streets of Raccoon City screaming.The door slams shut behind me. I\u2019m safe\u2026or maybe just cornered, trapped in this supply closet clutching an empty pistol and a knife, tossing pebbles at Goliath until he stops toying with me. And it\u2019s then that I say something I never thought I\u2019d say: \u201cI miss Mr. X.\u201dI am not done with , which is important context for everything I\u2019m about to say here. We didn\u2019t receive the PC version of until Thursday, and while I tried to finish it before today\u2026well, I didn\u2019t try very hard, because I\u2019m just not enjoying it very much.Having never played , I didn\u2019t know what to expect. All I knew was . It made me a fan\u2014of the , I said.But maybe I spoke too soon, because  is doing its damnedest to drive me away again. Despite taking place concurrently with the events of , and using the same engine and many of the same weapons and even a few of the same , this is a very different game.Mostly I miss the pacing of , the slow build from subtle horror to full-on action. Like many people, I fell in love with the Police Station. I loved how it expanded in layers, how each new key sent you further into its labyrinthine hallways. And I loved how you\u2019d inevitably arrive back where you started, and find everything the same, but . More zombies, or more powerful zombies\u2014and yet you were more powerful as well, better equipped to confront them.Those early hours are still some of my fondest memories of .Eventually you left the Police Station behind, and that more deliberate pacing along with it.  became an action game in its back half, but by then it felt like it had earned it. You\u2019d built up an arsenal, built up some ammo reserves, and it was cathartic to let loose on Mr. X and give him the ol\u2019 what-for. doesn\u2019t build. Not to the same degree, anyway. Zombies always come in groups here\u2014three, five, maybe more. There\u2019s a lot of shooting, and the game\u2019s not shy about giving you ammo to do it with. In , a dozen pistol rounds felt like a godsend. Here, I had pistol rounds in storage by the end of the first chapter, and I\u2019d already done twice as much shooting.Within an hour, you have a shotgun and a few hand grenades. Within two, you have a grenade launcher. Within three, an assault rifle. Your arsenal builds and builds, and none of it matters because Nemesis just keeps chasing you, and chasing you, and chasing you.And that\u2019s the key, I think. In , zombies were the main antagonist. Sure, Mr. X would show up here and there to ruin your day and send you running for safety. He\u2019d eventually wander off though, and you\u2019d be back to exploring.Nemesis isn\u2019t so forgiving. You don\u2019t just run Jill back to a Safe Room and wait for him to wander off. You need to attack him\u2014with grenades, with your shotgun, with whatever\u2019s at-hand. Failing that? You need to perfectly time a dodge and run past him, then hope he doesn\u2019t whip a tentacle-arm around your leg and send you sprawling on your back.Then he magically appears in front of you again, maybe on a roof or maybe bursting through another wall. Rinse and repeat.Is it challenging? I guess. I have certainly died more often in  than I did in . I\u2019m not finding it especially fun though. Running and shooting were two of the worst aspects of , and they take center stage here. I\u2019ve played through at least four interminable chase sequences already, two boss fights, and a holdout mission where I mowed down easily 30 or 40 zombies.Worse still are the \u201cHunters.\u201d First encountered in the sewers, these fleshy plant-dinosaurs are capable of devouring Jill whole, which in video game terms means they kill you in a single hit. Popping them with the grenade launcher kills them, but it\u2019s a long section spent fighting, and fighting, and fighting\u2014and then maybe dying because one of them appeared from off-screen and ate you before you could react. And it all happens in the sewers, one of the worst environments from  and no better here. They\u2019re not the only ones with one-hit kill cheap shots either. It\u2019s a running theme in .I keep hoping I\u2019ll find an area as charming and intricate as the Police Station, but it hasn\u2019t happened yet and seems less likely the longer I play. The opening stretch of Raccoon City holds promise, with Jill darting back and forth from donut shop to subway station to rail depot, but it\u2019s over and done in an hour and then you move on. It doesn\u2019t have nearly the same depth.And revisiting the Police Station a bit later as Carlos is just salt in the wound, as you\u2019re constrained to a mostly linear stretch of hallways between the entry hall and the STARS Office. \u201cThere\u2019s a weird door over here,\u201d Carlos says, and then his partner reminds him they have\u00a0 and that objective entails . Certainly not faffing about with heart-shaped keys and arcane statues.Are my expectations tainted by ? Absolutely, and I\u2019m sure there are people who didn\u2019t get on with that brand of survival horror, and who might fall in love with  and its more action-oriented pacing\u2014or fell in love with it 20 years ago, and are looking to rediscover that feeling.It\u2019s just not hooking me though. The linear level design, the combat focus, the cheap one-shot deaths (and annoying checkpoints), the omnipresent and omnipotent Nemesis\u2014it\u2019s like they made a game from all my least favorite aspects of . Turns out I was a fan of the classic  formula this whole time, and only impeded by the tank controls. Now I too can join the legions of forum dwellers arguing about where  lost its way, and how much action is \u201ctoo much.\u201dI\u2019m still planning to finish it, and who knows? Maybe it will win me over yet. It\u2019s running out of time though. I\u2019d guess I\u2019m towards the end, the relatively normal streets of Raccoon City having given way to (shock!) a secret Umbrella Corporation laboratory. I\u2019m very much in the setup for the final act, it feels like\u2014both based on what I\u2019ve seen in  and my existing knowledge of the timeline from . Let\u2019s just say: Whatever Jill\u2019s going to do, she\u2019s on a  to get it done right now.If anything changes, I\u2019ll be back to update this review accordingly. If not? Well, I  to be a fan.
