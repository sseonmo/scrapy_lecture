"When the words artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are used, people often think of advanced industries such as space exploration and biomedicine that rely heavily on research and development. The fact is, AI and ML should be something all industries are looking at, including retail. We are now in the customer service era and small differences in service can make a big difference in market share.This past week Nvidia held a , which has become a showcase for real life AI/ML use cases. Historically, the show has been a highly technical one, but over the years, it has evolved into an event where companies showcase how they use advanced technologies to transform their businesses.Domino’s is an example of a familiar retail business that presented how it’s using AI and ML. The company has come up with a successful recipe to change the way it operates. The secret ingredient is Nvidia’s technology, which the leading pizza chain is using to improve store and online operations, provide a better customer experience, and route orders more efficiently.As a result, Domino’s is seeing happier customers and more tips for its drivers. But that’s only a small piece of the multifaceted pie. So, what does it take to get pizza from a Domino’s store to someone’s house? The answer is quite complex.The data science team at Domino’s tested the company’s speed and efficiency by leveraging Nvidia’s DGX-1 server, an integrated software and hardware system for deep learning research. For those not familiar with the DGX server line, Nvidia has created a series of turnkey appliances businesses can drop in and start using immediately. The alternative is to cobble together hardware, software, and AI platforms and tune the entire system correctly. This can take weeks to do.The Domino’s team created a delivery prediction model that forecasts when an order would be ready, using attributes of the order and what is happening in a Domino’s store, such as the number of employees, managers, and customers present at that moment. The model was based on a large dataset of five million orders, which isn’t massive but large enough to create accurate models. All future orders are fed back into the system to further increase model accuracy.Domino’s previous models used GPU-enabled laptops and desktops and would take more than 16 hours to train. The long timeframe made it extremely difficult to improve on the model, said Domino’s data science and AI manager Zachary Fragoso during a presentation at virtual GTC 2020.The extra compute power of the DGX-1 enabled Domino’s data scientists to train more complex models in less time. The system reduced the training time to under an hour and increased accuracy for order forecasts from 75 percent to 95 percent. The test demonstrated how Domino’s could boost productivity by training models faster, Fragoso said.Domino’s uncovered another benefit in the process: resource sharing. Each individual GPU on the DGX-1 is so large—with 32 GB of RAM—Domino’s data scientists could use a fraction of the GPUs and run multiple tests simultaneously. With eight such GPUs at their fingertips, the data scientists found themselves sharing resources and knowledge, as well as collaborating across teams.In the past, sharing work across teams—including code reviews and quality assurance testing—was challenging, since data scientists worked in their own local environments. Now that data scientists are working with a common DGX-1 server, they’re easily able to share Docker containers that are fully customizable and reproducible. This gives the data scientists a large resource pool to work with and access to resources when needed, so they’re not sitting idle. The Docker solution that Domino’s integrated with DGX-1 also makes it easier to reproduce code across different environments because all the data is contained within the Docker image.Domino’s recently purchased a second DGX-1 and started adding the Kubernetes container management system to the mix. With Kubernetes managed by an optimization engine, Domino’s can dynamically allocate resources to all its data scientists and launch containers faster. According to Fragoso, even data scientists who aren’t familiar with Linux can point-and-click to launch Docker containers.On the deployment side, Domino’s created an inferencing stack, which includes a Kubernetes cluster and four Nvidia GPUs. This way, data scientists can interact with and build their models using the same Docker container framework they use on the DGX-1.Domino’s also acquired a machine learning operations platform called Datatron, which sits on top of the Kubernetes cluster with the GPUs and assists Domino’s with ML-specific functionalities. Datatron allows for model performance monitoring in real time, so data scientists can be notified if their model requires retraining.Bringing the inference stack in-house allows Domino’s to have all the benefits that the cloud providers offer for hosting ML models, while keeping all data and resources on premises. It has changed the way the data scientists deploy models, giving them much more control over the deployment process, Fragoso explained in his presentation.Fragoso concluded with advice for other companies looking to bring these technologies in-house: “Think about how your data scientists will work together and collaborate. In our case, the DGX-1 and our data scientists are interacting in a common workspace. It was something that our team didn’t really consider when we first acquired this product and has been a real value for us.”Historically, data scientists operated as an independent silo within companies. More and more, IT organization are being asked to take on the task of providing the right technology to AI and ML initiatives. Data scientists are expensive resources for most companies and having them sit around waiting for models to finish is akin to tossing good pizza out the window. The right infrastructure, such as the DGX server series, enables companies to speed up processing time to let the data scientists work more and wait less.This story, ""How AI helped Domino’s improve pizza delivery"" was originally published by

"Quarantine, day six. I’m standing in Paris, in one of my favorite spots. It’s a fountain in the Tuileries, near the Louvre. There are green metal chairs scattered around, inviting people to sit and relax for a few moments, or for an afternoon. Wind mixes with birdsong as I stand and take it all in. It feels as if I’m the last person on Earth, standing here alone in an empty park—but at least I’m outside.Quarantine, day seven. I’m in a different city, vaguely Soviet in appearance. Again, there is nobody else around—or nobody living, anyway. City 17 is quiet, but for the headcrabs. I holster my pistol and admire the crumbling remains of the North Star Hotel, imagine it in happier times.Day eight, I’m in space. Day nine, I’m on a safari. Every day a new experience without ever leaving my house. Virtual reality is keeping me sane in isolation.I’ll admit, I’m weathering San Francisco’s shelter-in-place better than a lot of people. I feel fortunate on that front. I’ve worked from home for going on eight years. My desk is here, my PC is here, and I’m (disconcertingly) used to spending hours in my bedroom without seeing anyone else. And hey, there are video games releasing. , , —I’ve been busy.Still, I’ve started to feel cooped up these last few days. It’s like breaking a finger or something. You don’t  notice how often you use your ring finger until you can’t. Similarly, I didn’t really appreciate how often I’d step outside day-to-day until I couldn’t anymore. Taking a walk to mull over an article idea barely registered in a world where I could leave my house, y’know, . But lately I’m feeling nostalgic about popping out to buy potato chips.Luckily, virtual reality is having a moment. Last week , which prompted me to pull my  off a shelf and plug it in. I’d been putting it off since moving to this apartment last summer, using  and recently  for the rare VR excursion. This was  though, and I was going to use the hardware even if it took 30 or 40 minutes of furniture arranging and setup.That process still sucks. It’s not difficult per se, but it’s annoying—like summoning the energy to go to the gym after a while away. But then it was done, and that meant not just  but the entirety of virtual reality was once again open to me. I’ve been spending a lot of time with the headset on this week, and I think it’s helping.There’s a practical aspect to it, obviously. It gets me out of my chair and away from my desk. That alone is important, forcing me to get up and walk around instead of staying sedentary all day. And I’m back to using VR as exercise on a daily basis.  and  are my games of choice, raising my heartrate for an hour or so at a time. It might not be as strenuous as going to the gym, but…well, that option’s not available right now. I can almost guarantee some basic cardio is better than sitting motionless for eight to ten hours.Exercise is only one small facet though. It’s just nice to be  for a few hours. that’s not my small San Francisco bedroom-apartment.I don’t get that escape from normal games. Not to the same extent, at least. Sure, video games are great time-wasters—and that’s vital, when you’re stuck inside for days on end. But I’m always very aware I’m playing a video game, at my desk, in my bedroom. I spent a kickass couple of days with , but it still felt like binging in isolation.Virtual reality is different though. It feels like it’s happening  me. Not all the time maybe, but in its best moments. Layers of artifice fall away. The headset brings me into the world. The controllers let me interact with it.I’ve always found  fascinating, but this week rekindled my love affair. Berlin, Paris, London, Dublin, Sydney, Mexico City, New York, all the world’s cities are here in my bedroom. And sure, Google Street View images are a pale imitation of reality—but with reality off-limits, virtual reality is the next-best option. It’s even reassuring in a way, traveling to popular tourist spots and seeing the crowds of people frozen in time, like a connection to “normal.” was just as important though. Maybe more important. City 17 isn’t a real place, but it felt real enough for the three or four days I spent reviewing . I’ve  and won’t belabor the discussion here, but suffice it to say combat wasn’t much of a highlight for me. Instead I enjoyed walking around a run-down zoo, or exploring a decommissioned distillery.There wasn’t much to do in those places except shoot headcrabs, but when I think back on this past week it still  like I left my house. As far as my brain is concerned, I wasn’t just cooped up in this bedroom the entire time treading the same 12-foot by 10-foot patch of floorboards. I was in that zoo. I was in that distillery. I was .That’s what has made virtual reality such a vital part of my day-to-day in lockdown. Earlier this week I visited London’s Natural History Museum and chatted with David Attenborough, courtesy of . Today I plan to visit the Smithsonian, as well. I even walked  Van Gogh’s  reimagined as a 3D space, courtesy of .There are also the old standbys of course. I’ve restarted  again, floating through space all by my lonesome.  and  are there when I need to relax. I never finished . That’s tempting given .And then  released last week, giving me another collection of places to explore. I don’t know why developer Fireproof chose to release the same week as , but they did and I’m grateful. Fireproof has always been great about setting up “a room,” as you might expect from the title. Every location I’ve seen in  is imbued with layer upon layer of secrets hidden in the scenery. The scale is smaller and the environments less realistic than , but it’s immensely satisfying tinkering with these overwrought machines and deciphering how they work one onion-layer at a time.I’m already hooked—and just like that, another day has passed.Anything is possible, and that’s the joy of it. I didn’t need a global pandemic to recognize the merits of virtual reality, but it’s certainly bolstered my appreciation. What was once only theoretical—applications of VR touted (in particular) by Facebook—now feels very real and very pertinent to my day-to-day life.That doesn’t mean I’m all-in on social VR yet, and I haven’t held any meetings with the headset on or anything. I’m not deep into it. It’s helping though. VR is the barest substitute for real-world interaction, but I’m finding it at least takes the edge off the isolation. There’s a world beyond my bedroom, and if I can’t go to it then I can at least bring it to me for a few hours at a time.This story, ""VR is keeping me sane while I'm stuck at home"" was originally published by

"The Blue Indoor Camera is one of three home do-it-yourself security cameras from ADT. The camera is USB powered and comes with support for motion zones and facial recognition to help cut down on the number of irrelevant alerts you might receive.All Blue products are styled in a rather utilitarian gray color and are a bit bulky. The design isn’t to my taste, but might be to yours. Regardless of how they look, they work well.The indoor camera offers a two-way talk feature, so you can remotely speak to people through the companion smartphone app. It also packs a CO2 and smoke alarm siren sensor. This will alert you if it hears a CO2 or smoke alarm going off in your house.All in all, it’s a pretty good number of features for the price.The camera can be used as a stand-alone device, with other cameras that each operate independently but are viewed within the same app, or as part of a larger security system. Right now the indoor camera works with the LifeShield system, which ADT purchased last year, and a dedicated Blue security system is promised for later this year.Getting the camera up and running is not much more difficult than plugging it in and pointing it. It’s USB-powered but includes a battery back-up for short power failures. It can’t be operated without wired power for a long period of time.Like the other Blue devices, getting the cam on a Wi-Fi network is simple. The companion app displays a QR code which you hold in front of the camera when it’s in set-up mode. The camera reads the QR code, which includes your Wi-Fi network name and password, and connects.The camera can be mounted on just about any surface, either free-standing or with a mounting bracket. You can even mount it upside down on a ceiling and then flip the video image in the app so it’s the right way up.The camera has several features that cost a premium on competing cameras. The first is the ability to set motion detection zones. This can be really handy if, for example, the movement of cars or trees outside a window sets off your camera. There are also settings to restrict alerts to certain hours of the day. When the camera is triggered, it will record for 30 seconds.The camera offers a 130-degree view, which is plenty wide enough to see most of what’s going on in most rooms. The image was sharp and looked good on a smarphone.Downloaded video was high-definition resolution of 1920x1080 pixels, but only 15 frames per second, which is half the typical frame rate. However, for this application that doesn’t really cause a problem.The two-way talk function worked well and dual microphones on the top of the camera helped with noise reduction and made conversations clearer. One nice feature on the top is a mute button, providing some privacy to anyone in the same room as the camera.An extra feature is local storage should the Wi-Fi network go down. The camera has a microSD card slot on the side and you’ll need to supply a memory card.In the end, despite an uninspired design and the lack of a true battery option, the Blue Indoor Camera has a solid feature set, good performance, and an easy setup, all at a decent price.This story, ""ADT Blue Indoor Camera review: Watches for intruders, listens for alarms"" was originally published by

"The YubiKey Bio is a security product seemingly made for the growing number of people  during the coronavirus threat, but the security issues facing remote workers are hardly new. Even if they’ve figured out everything else—bought a second monitor, rearranged some furniture, or upgraded their router—security remains an oft-forgotten, but vital detail.The transition from working in an office to working at home creates a juicy opportunity for attackers intent on stealing your personal information. “With a rapid shift toward remote workforces, the attack vector grows larger and we’re already seeing an increase in targeted phishing attacks,” said Guido Appenzeller, chief product officer of Yubico. “Not to mention, operating remotely is new territory for many companies, involving steep learning curves and confusion. This is the perfect scenario for an attacker to thrive in and opens opportunities for social engineering and phishing attacks.” That’s why Yubico is developing a security key with built-in biometrics for the ultimate portable encrypted key.The bottom line is, your office brings a level of built-in security that’s not as readily available at home. Even if your Wi-Fi is WPA2-encrypted with a strong password, the security on your PC and personal accounts likely pales in comparison to the firewalls and intranets inside your office. “This is the perfect scenario for an attacker to thrive in and opens opportunities for social engineering and phishing attacks––making it imperative for businesses to develop a contingency plan that includes securing remote workers,” said Appenzeller. “Enabling multi-factor authentication wherever possible is one of the best ways to protect a remote team and should be a top requirement for a work-from-home policy.”Of course, we already know that. Beyond your company’s specific authentication strategy, you’ve probably already set it up on your mail and social media accounts using SMS or an authenticator app. That’s a great start. But in a world where remote work is blowing up, even two-factor authentication via SMS might not offer enough protection from the sudden collision of your professional and personal accounts. Yubico’s Appenzeller says there are better solutions out there. “If I had to pick one authentication method, I would pick FIDO2,” said Appenzeller. “It’s really well thought through and finally combines the notion of external authenticators like the YubiKey with the internal authenticators on devices.”The FIDO standard (Fast ID Online) replaces single-factor password-only logins with an incredibly secure experience that is virtually hack-proof. FIDO2 takes it a step further by allowing users to log onto Internet accounts using on-device biometrics such as Windows Hello or Pixel Imprint for certain applications, or with a pocketable security key, such as a Yubico YubiKey or Google Titan Security Key.Instead of retrieving a code via text or app, your security key does all the work. When you choose a physical key as your authentication method, your browser or device will ask you to plug in (USB) or hold your USB key nearby (NFC or Bluetooth), then prompt you to touch the sensor on the key to authenticate your login. An attacker would need both your password and your physical key to log into your account on a new device.Security keys could start becoming the norm as businesses grapple with a scattered workforce. Companies will be scrambling to beef up their remote encryption efforts to ensure older devices and newer accounts are as secure as possible.Back at Microsoft Ignite in November, 2019, Yubico unveiled , which adds biometric authentication to the dongle itself. When it releases sometime this year, YubiKey Bio will look a lot like the regular USB-A YubiKey Security Key with one exception: the gold touch sensor will have an actual fingerprint sensor, so no one else will be able to use it even if it’s stolen.“Our goal is to deliver a very similar user experience in terms of form factor and robustness as we do with the current key,” Appenzeller explained, adding that FIDO2 makes it very hard to crack. “FIDO2 has this notion of fingerprints being identified or you have exceeded the maximum number of tries and so on, which previously wasn’t there. So these two things coming together was sort of a no-brainer for us.”It might be a no-brainer for businesses too. While most laptops still don’t have biometric security built into them, YubiKey Bio could be a way to bridge that gap and bring modern biometrics to older laptops without needing to swap out the whole system.By taking the biometric out of your laptop and putting it onto a pocketable device, it addresses threats and complexity. If someone steals your laptop, it’s useless. If you forget your password, you’ll still be able to log in. And if you switch to a different device, your authentication will move with you. “With the biometric key, you can basically add that extra layer of security and no longer need a PIN (to log on). Showing the presence of the fingerprint plus possession of the key is enough,” said Appenzeller. In an uncertain world where workers are being asked to be more versatile than ever before and businesses need to manage a workforce that’s gone from feet to miles apart, YubiKey Bio could bring the security we want and the sanity we need. While it will work only with USB-A at launch, a USB-C model is in the works.Yubico’s Appenzeller imagines YubiKey working with a wide range of devices. “Long term, more and more consumers will have some form of hardware token that they use in order to protect their asset,” he predicted.Appenzeller believes the YubiKey Bio makes solid security nearly foolproof. “The YubiKey Bio is a big step forward because it gives you a high level of security with better usability. My colleague can’t just grab my key and impersonate me.”This story, ""How YubiKey Bio could make remote security concerns a thing of the past"" was originally published by

"The MacBook Air is Apple’s best-loved and best-selling laptop. It’s thin, light, powerful enough for most people, and it’s the least expensive option in Apple’s laptop lineup.Apple finally brought the MacBook Air  with the addition of USB-C, Touch ID, a Retina display, and the removal of MagSafe and USB-A. But that laptop also ditched the old scissor-switch keyboard for the much-maligned butterfly keyboard, and boosted the starting price to $1,199 without giving you more storage.In 2019, Apple knocked $100 off the price and added True Tone to the display, but that was it. It’s a fine laptop, but not a particularly good deal. This year, with faster processors, double the starting storage, the new Magic Keyboard, and a $999 starting price, the MacBook Air is back to being the great deal it was before.One of our gripes with the 2018 and 2019 MacBook Air is that it featured an Intel Core i5-8210Y, and  that one processor. It was hardly an upgrade over the previous generation except that it offered better graphics performance. If you wanted more muscle, you were out of luck, as Apple offered no other processor options.The new 2020 MacBook Air uses Intel’s new 10th-generation “Ice Lake” processors, which feature a new microarchitecture. All you need to know is that the clock speeds are lower but performance is generally higher, especially graphics performance.At the $999 starting price, you get a Core i3-1000NG4, a dual-core processor which is a little on the pokey side. $100 more nets you a Core i5-1030NG7, a quad-core processor that offers a significant speed boost across the board. Another $150 gets you a Core i7-1060NG7 which is faster still, but probably not worth the price for most people.Apple offers two standard configurations. One costs $999 and gives you the Core i3, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage. The other, at $1,299, is the one we reviewed; it still has 8GB of RAM but upgrades you to that quad-core Core i5 processor and doubles the starting storage to 512GB. It’s probably the sweet spot for most users. You can upgrade to 16GB of RAM for $200 at the time of purchase, but it’s not upgradable after the fact. There are also 1TB and 2TB storage options.Our benchmarks show a boost in single-core processor speed of around 20 percent over the 2018 and 2019 MacBook Air, and multi-threaded processor performance of anywhere from 40 to 70 percent higher. This isn’t a computer you’ll want to do serious high-end video editing with every day, but it’s plenty fast for most people.Battery life on the 2018/2019 MacBook Air was just as good as the old MacBook Air—an impressive feat considering the updated Retina display. This year’s model takes a bit of a step back.In our video rundown test, where we loop a video with the display set at 150 nits, the new 2020 MacBook Air lasted just slightly less than 9 hours. That’s about 15 percent less than the 2018 model.In day-to-day use, we had no problem doing simple office tasks and web browsing for an entire work day, with modest breaks. Battery life still seems slightly less robust than on past models, but we haven’t quite reached the point where it’s cause for concern. Compared to other premium thin-and-light 13-inch laptops, the 2020 MacBook Air offers good battery life, but is not at the top of the pack.Six years ago, Apple’s laptop keyboards were universally praised. With the introduction of the 12-inch MacBook, Apple started to transition laptops to a new keyboard with a “butterfly” mechanism rather than the “scissor-switch” mechanism of old.Apple of course will never admit it, but very few users liked it better, and most  it. It was also a .With the , Apple went back to a scissor-switch mechanism keyboard, dubbed the Magic Keyboard. The MacBook Air is now the second Mac laptop to get this keyboard, and we assume the rest of the line will follow on quickly.It’s not quite identical to the old scissor-switch keyboard—keys feel a little more “solid” with less wobble—but it has more travel and bounce than the butterfly keyboard, and it’s a  quieter. The click-clank thumping sound is gone. It’s once again a joy to type on, and your coworkers around the conference table won’t get mad at you for daring to take notes on a MacBook.At long last, our keyboard nightmare is over.The MacBook Air is still the only Mac laptop you can get  the Touch Bar, which is a big win. You still get Touch ID, but the physical row of function keys is a step up from a secondary touch display that you have to take your eyes off the main display to use.You may have noticed, but we’re currently in the midst of a global pandemic that has a lot of people working from home and holding virtual meetings. It’s a situation that really drives home just how truly awful the built-in webcams are on every Mac, and the new MacBook Air is no exception.It’s still the same 720p webcam we’ve seen on the Air for years. The resolution isn’t necessarily the problem (though 1080p should be the minimum standard). It’s everything else: the detail and dynamic range, the noise, the color balance. It’s just a  webcam.Look at the comparison above between the MacBook Air and a Logitech C920 webcam I’ve had since 2012. Sure, that was a premium webcam when it was new, but it’s now  and it’s absolutely trouncing Apple’s camera under the same exact conditions, with video captured using the same exact program (Apple’s Photo Booth).Frankly, I don’t understand this at all. Apple is keen to constantly improve the front-facing cameras on iPhones and iPads. It’s laptops, the least-expensive of which costs $1,000 or more, are years behind the times. Apple’s crummy webcams are not a new problem, but the sudden surge in tele-commuting and virtual meetings has shone a light on it.Of course, if you use an external webcam to get decent quality, you’re probably also going to have to pick up a USB-A to USB-C dongle, because Mac laptops don’t have USB-A ports anymore (oddly enough, Mac desktops still do) and nearly all webcams have USB-A plugs. There’s plenty of room for a USB-A plug on the right side, next to the headphone jack.Apple should really include its  in the box.The new 2020 MacBook Air is not exciting. It doesn’t  anything the old MacBook Air didn’t. It gets rid of the bad keyboard in favor of one like the old keyboard we all loved, but Apple gets zero points for fixing what it never should have broken. It also offers processor three options that give you more speed (not that top-end performance is what people buy a MacBook Air for).Mainly, it delivers more bang for the buck. The starting price is back to $999, where it feels like the MacBook Air should always be. That gets you 256GB of storage instead of 128GB; an upgrade that should have happened in 2018. The $1,299 model we reviewed, with 512GB of storage and a faster quad-core processor, is a nice sweet spot that represents good value and longevity.It’s not without sore spots, though. The webcam is atrocious for a laptop in this price range. Battery life, once the calling card of the MacBook Air, is a little worse now. It’s not a problem, but we can no longer count leading battery life among the Air’s strengths.It’s high time for Apple to shake up the MacBook line with exciting new designs and capabilities. In absence of that, this update to the MacBook Air is a better value than the 2018 or 2019 models, and an easier upgrade to recommend for those still hanging on to their five-year-old model.This story, ""MacBook Air (2020) review: More bang for your buck"" was originally published by

"Monday, November 25, 2019 was a momentous day. On it, AMD’s benchmark-shattering, floor-wiping, mic-dropping  launched alongside Intel’s most potent consumer chip, the . The wild performance difference between the two respective champions drove home a truth that’s been slowly building and is suddenly here: For the first time since Intel’s Core architecture ended the Athlon 64’s dominance nearly 15 long years ago, after an AMD Bulldozer era seemingly endless with disappointment, AMD’s Ryzen processors are firmly in control on the desktop.It’s been coming. AMD’s new-look Ryzen chips, built using multiple conjoined dies under the hood rather than a typical monolithic design, shook the up the status quo when they launched in 2017. “” our headline blared.Over the previous decade, computing innovation had stagnated. AMD’s bold Bulldozer gambit failed, and while Intel’s Core chips provided solid incremental advances year-over-year, they didn’t push the multi-core performance envelope. Mainstream PCs were stuck in neutral with dual- or quad-core processors , and every year’s four-core chip cost just as much as previous ones. In May 2016, with Ryzen rumors flying, Intel released the unprecedented , for a just-as-unprecedented $1,723—a $700 premium over 8-core chips. Rather than reward such bold money-grabbing, our Full Nerd podcast’s crew . Times were bleak.Then Ryzen happened.Where Intel only offered a single $1,089 8-core chip for its pricey high-end desktop platform, AMD flooded the field with cores and threads. The flagship Ryzen 7 1800X cost $499, but you could pick up an 8-core Ryzen 7 1700 for just $330, and six-core, 12-thread Ryzen 5 parts for as little as $220. While Intel’s budget chips topped out at two cores, AMD’s affordable Ryzen 3 CPUs offered four. Ryzen was a revelation, and for the first time in ages,  to counter the threat.But like any first-gen product, AMD’s new architecture wasn’t perfect. First-gen Ryzen chips delivered outstanding multi-core performance, but their clock speeds and instructions per clock (IPC) lagged behind Intel’s finely honed 14nm Core chips. Ryzen faltered in applications that demanded strong single-thread performance, most notably in 1080p gaming workloads that delivered far fewer frames per second on AMD’s hardware. First-gen Ryzen still did  in those tasks, but they weren’t better for everybody and AMD had a lot of room to improve.Second-gen Ryzen processors, built on the refined Zen+ architecture, did just that. This time around, we said that “.” AMD improved both performance and price, with the flagship 8-core Ryzen 7 2700X topping out at a mere $330,  a bundled Wraith CPU cooler. AMD boosted overall clock speeds, tweaked memory cache and latency, and introduced algorithms like Precision Boost 2 and Extended Frequency Range (XFR) 2 to let its chips hit those higher clocks more consistently.The end result? “In the battle of Intel and AMD’s flagship processors, the clear winner today is the Ryzen 7 2700X,” we wrote at the time. There were still caveats—gaming and single-thread performance still trailed Intel, though by a much less noticeable amount—but AMD was clearly bringing the fight to Intel.Intel, on the other hand, started struggling right around the time of AMD’s ascent. The company’s vaunted manufacturing arm failed to migrate to the 10nm manufacturing process on time, stalling its Core processors on increasingly refined versions of 14nm cores ever since . That’s five full generations of 14nm revisions at this point, and  suggest Intel’s next-gen desktop chips will run on , too.Simultaneously, the much-publicized  required Intel to release software mitigations that slowed down its processors, while  from the Core i5 and i7 lineups (possibly to help combat those security flaws). The company’s factories have also struggled to meet demand for chips. Intel, “Chipzilla,” found itself uniquely weak for the first time in a long time.Enter third-gen Ryzen.While Intel’s stalled on 14nm, AMD’s latest processors are the first ever built using the groundbreaking 7nm process. Better yet, third-gen Ryzen chips pushed the advantage by tapping redesigned “Zen 2” cores with twice the floating point performance and a 15 percent IPC increase over previous Ryzen chips. Clock speeds increased, too. AMD also overhauled instruction pre-fetching, doubled the L3 cache for vastly improved gaming performance, significantly rejiggered its chiplet design for lower latency, and more. These are the first processors to support the , and AMD even managed to increase core counts for its mainstream AM4 platform, hitting a massive 16 cores.That’s a lot of technicalese, so here’s the translation: Third-gen Ryzen chips are loaded with cores and damned fast. Previous gaming and single-thread performance concerns have disappeared, and some AMD chips even pack higher IPC than rival Intel CPUs. “There are very few reasons left to buy a Core i9 today. The reasons left are real, but for probably 9 out of 10 consumers looking at a high-end CPU, they’ll want to buy ,” we said in our review.The sentiment holds true from top to bottom. In our guide to , AMD chips hold down the Budget and Best Overall selections.  officially holds the fastest gaming crown, hitting 5GHz on all cores after five years of 14nm refinement, but AMD’s Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 9 chips nevertheless play like champs and are the better options for most people thanks to their higher core counts and lower prices.“The Ryzen 9 3900X is likely as significant, and likely as game-changing, as AMD’s original K7 Athlon-series of CPUs that crossed the 1GHz line first, or its Athlon 64 CPU that ushered in 64-bit computing in a desktop PC,” we declared. Moving up the chain, we called the  “an epic end-zone dance over Intel”—and since then, we’ve seen it beat Intel’s 18-core Core i9-10980XE champion in some tasks. As for the , we said its “32 cores of unbeatable power” simply “blow away Intel’s best.” To add insult to injury, AMD even launched a .No matter your budget, most people should buy Ryzen right now. Sure, Intel still holds an advantage in some tasks—Intel’s Quick Sync tech can make a huge difference in specific video editing workloads, Photoshop tends to prefer Intel’s Core chips, and if you want to pair a high-end graphics card with a high-end chip to drive as many frames as possible to a 1080p gaming monitor, the Core i9-9900K is the way to go. In general, Core i7 chips are still a great option for “pure gamers.” Intel excels at deep learning workloads and tasks that tap into AVX-512 instructions.But where before, you needed a specific reason to opt for an AMD chip over Intel, in 2019, third-gen Ryzen’s dominance means you should have a specific reason to opt for Intel over an AMD processor.My, how the tables have turned.Don’t count Intel out quite yet. It’s still larger than AMD many times over, and Intel Core chips have maintained an iron grip on the crucial laptop market, where Ryzen chips have struggled with power efficiency—though new  built using the same Zen 2 cores as 3rd-gen Ryzen just arrived, and whupped on every Intel gaming chip on offer in its . And remember: Last time Intel was on the ropes, it pulled out Conroe and the Core microarchitecture, kicking off over 15 years of undisputed triumph. There’s a reason why people call Intel “Chipzilla.”But for now, David’s knocked off Goliath. Third-gen Ryzen processors rule the desktop from top to bottom, and AMD deserves every bit of praise it’s received for pushing computing into the multi-core future after years of stagnation. “The 32-core Threadripper 3970X runs unopposed in our eyes,” our evaluation concluded.Bravo.This story, ""AMD ascending: How Ryzen CPUs snatched the computing crown from Intel"" was originally published by

"In a world where I wasn’t confined to my home, this article would be filled with my impressions of Fitbit’s latest fitness tracker, the Charge 4. I would have written about the feel of it on my wrist, the responsiveness of the display, and tested the new Spotify integration that brings playback controls to your wrist for the first time.But it's possible that those features wouldn’t have added all that much to my impressions of the device. You see, on the outside, the Fitbit Charge 4 is identical to the Fitbit Charge 3, with an inductive button, 1.36-inch display, and swappable band system. Even the $150 price tag remains. The only thing that’s changed is the color: Instead of rose gold, Fitbit now offers a “rosewood” color that’s something of a cross between dark magenta and a deep red wine.Otherwise, all of the new stuff on the inside of the Fitbit 4, so I’ll need to get out and use it to see how much better it is. The biggest addition is built-in GPS, making it the only Fitbit device other than the  that doesn’t rely on your phone for distance tracking. That alone makes it a worthy upgrade over the Charge 2 and is probably enough to sway more than a few Charge 3 owners to plunk down another $150, too.Fitbit says the Charge 4’s design will “optimize GPS performance,” but you’ll still see a significant loss in battery life if you keep it on. With continuous GPS usage, you’ll get an estimated five days of battery life, which is still very good but about two days less than you will get with it off. Thankfully, Fitbit makes it easy to disable via a toggle in settings.The rest of the Charge 4’s new features will eventually make their way to other Fitbit devices if they haven’t already. Debuting on the Charge 4 is Fitbit’s newest exercise mode, Active Zone Minutes. Rolling out “soon” to all Fitbit smartwatches, the new feature “uses your personalized heart rate zones to track your effort for any energizing activity,” so you’ll get a clearer picture of your health.For example, you’ll earn more “credit” for running than walking, even if you take the same number of steps. Your Charge 4 will automatically alert you when you’ve changed zones and in the Fitbit app you’ll find a detailed summary of your progress, based on the World Health Organization and American Heart Association’s recommendations of 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous activity each week.Fitbit is also bringing new sleep tracking features that were previously only available on the Versa and Ionic smartwatches. You’ll see your Sleep Score, which measures the quality of your sleep using the heart-rate and relative SpO2 sensors, as well as the battery-saving sleep mode. Smart Wake, which uses machine learning to gradually wake you up rather than jolting you out of sleep at a set time, is coming soon.The Charge 4 is also Fitbit’s first tracker that lets you control music, though you’ll need your phone and a Spotify Premium subscription. Like the Versa Lite, you can’t pair Bluetooth headphones to the Charge 4, so you’re limited to rudimentary controls such as play, shuffle, skip, and likes. Fitbit has also made NFC standard on the Charge 4 for contacts payments with Fitbit Pay.While not exclusive to the Charge 4, Fitbit will also be opening up some 40 new pieces of Premium content to all users in the Fitbit app. Plus, all users will get 90 days of free access to advanced sleep tools, customized programs, and more than 200 workouts. And coming soon, Fitbit will also offer workouts for both free and premium users to help users reach their Active Zone Minutes goal.The Fitbit Charge 4 is available for preorder at Firtbit.com, Amazon, and Best Buy beginning on Tuesday, March 31, for delivery April 13. The Charge 4 SE, which adds a second exclusive granite reflective black woven band along with the classic black band will retail for $170.This story, ""Fitbit launches the Charge 4 with built-in GPS, few other changes "" was originally published by

"Slated for release next month, an update for Roku’s streaming video players will offer more “visual” results when searching with voice commands, as well as direct playback for videos and the ability to respond to Spanish commands.The biggest improvements in Roku OS 9.3, which is set to begin rolling out to “select” Roku devices in April, are focused on Roku Voice, the feature that allows you to search for movies and TV shows and launch video channels using voice commands spoken into the Roku remote. The , , , and  players all come with voice-enabled Roku remotes.For starters, Roku OS 9.3 will enhance Roku Voice search results, serving up a more “visual” layout complete with categorized rows featuring relevant movies, TV shows, and “short-form” entertainment. The search results for a given title will be sorted according to price and won’t be biased in favor of a particular channel, Roku says.The update will also allow for “direct playback” from voice search, meaning that if you perform a Roku Voice search for a given movie or TV show, playback will begin automatically “when possible,” Roku says. More than 50 of Roku’s video channels support the “Playback from Search” feature, including Acorn, HBO Now, and Showtime.Roku Voice will also become more savvy when it comes to the news. For example, you’ll be able to jump to a “Roku Zone” featuring news channels when you say, “Show me the news,” or you can say “Play the news” to tune into ABC News’s live stream in The Roku Channel. To see a specific news stream, you’ll be able to say “Play the news on…” and then name your news source.Spanish language support will be coming to Roku Voice in the U.S. and Mexico, allowing you to launch video channels and search for videos by title, actor, or genre, as well as control video playback. Meanwhile, Roku Voice users in Canada, Ireland, and the United Kingdom will get enhanced voice commands that are already available in the U.S., such as more “natural” voice commands including “I want to watch” or “Show me,” as well as media playback controls like “Fast forward” or “Pause.”Non voice-related improvements included in the Roku OS update include a new navigation bar for the Roku mobile app that allows for quick switching between controlled Roku devices, as well as quick-access buttons on the remote control screen for launching recently viewed video channels.Also new are “theme packs” that will allow U.S. users to customize their Roku home screens with matching wallpapers and screensavers, while Roku Smart Soundbar users will be able to use the TV interface to access more soundbar settings and pair Bluetooth devices or other Roku speakers, such as Roku TV Wireless Speakers or the Roku Wireless Subwoofer.Finally, Roku says the update should shorten boot times for its various players, as well as boost the responsiveness of the Roku home screen and menu navigation.Roku OS 9.3 will start rolling out to “select” Roku players in April (no details yet on exactly which Roku players will be getting the update first), while “all” players (including the Roku Smart Soundbar) will get the update in “the coming weeks.” Roku TVs will get the update later this year.This story, ""Roku’s voice-enabled features are poised for a boost in an upcoming OS update"" was originally published by
